overview
=======================
The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.

A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.

Features
=======================
* Core technologies: dependency injection, events, resources, i18n, validation, data binding, type conversion, SpEL, AOP.

* Testing: mock objects, TestContext framework, Spring MVC Test, WebTestClient.
